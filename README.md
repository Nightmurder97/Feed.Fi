Feed.Fi: A Modern AI-Powered Crypto News Reader

Feed.Fi is a modern, minimalist RSS/Atom feed reader explicitly designed for cryptocurrency, investment, and trading news. It integrates advanced Artificial Intelligence capabilities for features like automatic summarization, sentiment analysis, and smart market insights.

Project Evolution & Key Milestones

The Feed.Fi project began as a comprehensive refactoring and rebranding of the existing NetNewsWire application. The journey involved significant architectural changes, UI modernization, and iterative problem-solving to achieve a stable and feature-rich application.

Phase 1: Initial Transformation & Core AI/UI Implementation

The initial phase focused on a complete overhaul of the NetNewsWire project:

• **Rebranding:** The application was fully rebranded from "NetNewsWire" to "Feed.Fi," including updates to the app name, bundle ID (`com.ranchero.NetNewsWire` changed to `com.feedfi.app`), and other internal references.

• **AI Architecture & Integration:** A modular AI architecture was designed, with initial integration of the Google Gemini API. This enabled key functionalities:

    ◦ **Automatic Summarization:** A "Resumen IA" (AI Summary) button was added to the article view, triggering content submission to the Gemini API for concise summaries focused on key points.    ◦ **Sentiment Analysis:** Articles are automatically analyzed for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) in their headlines and content, with visual indicators (green/red/gray) displayed in the timeline and detail view.    ◦ **Market Insights:** An "Insights IA" panel was created to provide predictions and potential impacts on the crypto market, including confidence levels.    ◦ **Gemini API Configuration:** The environment was set up for Gemini API, including endpoint, rate limiting (60 requests per minute), configurable timeout (default: 30 seconds), and robust error handling.

• **Modern User Interface (UI) Implementation:** The UI was redesigned to be modern, clean, and minimalist, consistent with the provided design captures.

    ◦ **Translucent Sidebar:** Implemented with native macOS blur effects and configurable transparency, featuring simplified navigation, modern SF Symbols icons, and smooth animations.    ◦ **Updated Article List (Timeline):** Features a responsive grid layout with image previews, sentiment color indicators, and modern SF Symbols icons.    ◦ **Redesigned Article Detail View:** Presents a centered layout with generous margins, integrated AI buttons and panels, and responsiveness to different window sizes.

• **Comprehensive Customization System:** Allows users to personalize the app's appearance:

    ◦ **Predefined Themes:** Including Feed.Fi (default blue), Dark, Light, and a fully customizable option.    ◦ **Advanced Configuration:** Control over typography (font sizes and weights), spacing (margins and padding), effects (rounded borders, shadows), and SF Symbols icon customization.    ◦ **Theme Management:** Typography system correctly set up in `ThemeManager.swift`. Customizable components include 15+ UI elements, with persistence via `UserDefaults` (JSON encoding) and real-time updates via `Combine`.

• **Initial Setup & Documentation:** An `install.sh` script was created for automated setup, and documentation (including `README.md` and `README_Version2.md`) was updated to reflect new features and configurations.

Phase 2: Addressing Persistent Build Challenges

During development, several persistent compilation and build errors arose, primarily related to the extensive renaming and integration efforts.

• **Compilation Errors in** **ThemeManager.swift** **(SwiftUI/AppKit Mix-up):**

    ◦ **Problem:** Initial attempts to use SwiftUI `Font` and `Color` types directly within an AppKit context (macOS traditional) in `ThemeManager.swift` caused errors like "Type 'Font' (aka 'NSFont') has no member 'system'" and issues with `Codable` conformance for `NSFont` (as it's not a final class). The property `.tertiary` was also not directly available in SwiftUI for macOS.    ◦ **Resolution:**        ▪ Changed `import SwiftUI` to `import AppKit` in relevant files.        ▪ Converted `Color` to `NSColor` where compatibility was needed and removed `Codable` conformance from `CustomColors` and `NSFont`.        ▪ Replaced `.tertiary` color references with `Color(NSColor.tertiaryLabelColor)`.        ▪ Adjusted `typographyRow` function in `AppearancePreferencesView.swift` to explicitly map `NSFont` to `SwiftUI.Font` and use `SwiftUI.Font.system` with appropriate size and weight derivation, avoiding direct `NSFont` usage in SwiftUI views.    ◦ **Outcome:** These specific compilation errors in `ThemeManager.swift`, `ModernTimelineView.swift`, and `ModernDetailView.swift` were resolved.

• **Code Signing and Bundle Identifier Errors:**

    ◦ **Problem:** After renaming the project, Bundle Identifiers and Code Signing configurations continued to reference the original "NetNewsWire" project and `ranchero` domain, leading to compilation failures like "No profiles for 'com.feedfi.Feed.Fi' were found".    ◦ **Resolution:**        ▪ Updated all `Bundle Identifiers` from `com.ranchero.NetNewsWire` to `com.feedfi.Feed.Fi` (and corresponding extensions) across `.xcconfig` files and `project.pbxproj`.        ▪ Updated the `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` ID in configuration files.        ▪ A local development configuration file (`SharedXcodeSettings/DeveloperSettings.xcconfig`) was created and added to `.gitignore` to manage local settings without affecting version control.        ▪ The process emphasized using Xcode's "Automatically manage signing" feature under the "Signing & Capabilities" tab for easier local development.    ◦ **Outcome:** Code Signing and Bundle Identifier issues were resolved, allowing Feed.Fi to compile correctly with automatic signing and unique bundle IDs.

• **project.pbxproj** **Corruption and Duplicate Tasks (****GUID** **Errors):**

    ◦ **Problem:** Persistent build failures due to "Unexpected duplicate tasks" and "Could not compute dependency graph: unable to load transferred PIF: The workspace contains multiple references with the same GUID". This was largely caused by manual editing of the `project.pbxproj` file, which is highly sensitive to syntax errors (e.g., missing semicolons, malformed entries, comments) and duplicate framework references (especially `RSCore`). Old file names and incorrect entitlements also contributed.    ◦ **Root Cause Analysis:** Identified multiple redundant `RSCore` references in different targets (main app, share extension, safari extension) causing duplicate CodeSign and Copy tasks. The `project.pbxproj` was determined to be corrupted by manual edits, preventing Xcode from parsing it correctly.    ◦ **Resolution Strategy:**        ▪ **Restoration:** The primary recommendation was to restore the `project.pbxproj` file from a functional backup, preferably from the original NetNewsWire repository, to ensure a clean slate.        ▪ **Deep Cleaning:** Performed deep cleaning of Xcode's `DerivedData` and other caches (`rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/`) to force a fresh build and pick up all changes.        ▪ **Manual Corrections (when restoration not possible):** Attempts were made to manually fix truncated blocks (e.g., `RSTree`) and remove specific problematic lines like `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = MNAHBK54PT;` directly from `project.pbxproj`.        ▪ **Configuration Best Practices:** Emphasized moving `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` and `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` settings exclusively to `.xcconfig` files and linking them via Xcode's "Info" tab, rather than embedding them directly in `project.pbxproj`.        ▪ **CloudKitZone Fixes:** Compilation errors in `CloudKitZone.swift` were resolved by separating source code (an extension of `CloudKitZone`) from `Package.swift` into a new file, `CloudKitZone+Operations.swift`, and correcting API usage (e.g., `CKRecordZoneSubscription` syntax, deprecated initializers).    ◦ **Outcome:** The project was successfully restored and renamed, `project.pbxproj` issues (corruption, duplicate GUIDs) were resolved, and Swift compilation errors in `CloudKitZone` were fixed. The project now opens and compiles correctly in Xcode.

Phase 3: AI Model Optimization (Gemini 2.5 Flash)

A strategic decision was made to optimize the AI integration by switching from Gemini 2.5 Pro to Gemini 2.5 Flash for its enhanced price-performance ratio and adaptive thinking capabilities.

• **Benefits of Gemini 2.5 Flash:**

    ◦ **Cost Optimization:** Better price-performance and optimized 8K tokens output (compared to 65K tokens of Pro, leading to ~87% cost reduction for current functionalities) while maintaining analysis quality.    ◦ **Adaptive Thinking:** Improved reasoning for market analysis and smarter trend analysis due to native thinking capabilities.    ◦ **Advanced Capabilities:** Native support for PDFs (allowing analysis of whitepapers), batch processing, structured JSON outputs, and native audio capabilities (for future functionalities).    ◦ **Future-Proofing:** Provides a strong foundation for future audio features, compatibility with Live API, and scalability.

• **Implementation Status:**

    ◦ The model in `GeminiAIService.swift` was updated to 2.5 Flash.    ◦ Token limits were optimized for 8K output.    ◦ Adaptive thinking was activated for analysis.    ◦ Documentation was updated.

• **Next AI Steps:** Implement support for PDFs, configure batch processing, conduct performance tests, and optimize prompts for Flash.

Installation & Configuration

Prerequisites

• macOS 12.0+ with Xcode 14+.

• Swift 5.7+.

• Python 3.10+ (optional, for external AI scripts).

• Google AI Studio account for Gemini API key.

Steps to Run Feed.Fi

1\. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`.

2\. **Configure Environment Variables:** Copy the example file and add your Gemini API key: `cp .env.example .env`. Edit `.env` and set `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key`.

3\. **Configure Xcode:** Ensure `SharedXcodeSettings/DeveloperSettings.xcconfig` is set up for local configuration. This file should not be committed to version control.

4\. **Install Python Dependencies (Optional):** If using external AI scripts: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

5\. **Open in Xcode:** `open Feed.Fi.xcodeproj`.

6\. **Select Scheme and Destination:** In Xcode, select the "NetNewsWire" scheme (which now correctly points to the "Feed.Fi" target) and "My Mac" as the destination.

7\. **Build and Run:** Press `⌘ + R` or the `▶️` button to compile and execute the application.

Key Learnings & Best Practices

• **Avoid Manual** **project.pbxproj** **Edits:** The `project.pbxproj` file is a delicate plain text plist format that is prone to corruption from manual edits, including comments, malformed lines, or incorrect syntax. Such edits can prevent Xcode from opening or compiling the project. Always prefer Xcode's GUI for project configurations.

• **Centralize Build Settings:** Critical build settings like `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` and `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` should be managed via `.xcconfig` files rather than directly in `project.pbxproj`. This separates configuration from code, allows for inheritance, prevents accidental overwrites, and simplifies CI/CD.

• **Deep Cleaning is Crucial:** When encountering persistent build errors, a deep clean of Xcode's `DerivedData` and caches (`rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/`) is often necessary to ensure Xcode rebuilds from a clean state and picks up all changes.

• **SwiftUI and AppKit Interoperability:** When mixing SwiftUI views with AppKit components, be explicit with type declarations. Use `SwiftUI.Font` and `SwiftUI.Color` within SwiftUI contexts and convert `NSFont`/`NSColor` to their SwiftUI counterparts when passing them to SwiftUI views, rather than relying on implicit conversions or `Codable` conformance for system classes.

• **Version Control & Backups:** Always maintain regular backups or use Git version control, especially before making significant project-level changes. The original repository serves as an effective backup for restoring corrupted project files.

*Feed.Fi - The future of crypto news with AI* 🚀

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Next Step:** Given the extensive issues encountered with the `project.pbxproj` and the challenges in correctly setting up code signing, it is critical to ensure a repeatable and robust build process. A good next step would be to **implement a pre-build script that automates the cleanup of DerivedData and verification of key project settings (like Bundle Identifiers and** **xcconfig** **links) before each build**. This can help prevent common issues from recurring and ensure a consistent development environment. Would you like me to outline the steps and commands for creating such a pre-build script?
